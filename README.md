# KM620

This is a Julia package defining the equations from ASME Section VIII Division 3 KM-620.
It is meant to be a dependency of other packages needing these definitions.

The equations may be viewed in rendered form by opening `src/KM620_notebook.jl` with [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/)
or by opening the exported `KM620_notebook.html` in your web browser.
